These images were obtained from the SDSS images from the Galaxy Zoo Data release 2. The images were processed and published so that the general public can classify the galaxy images, since there are so many. After many classified images, it was determined that ~38 classifications were made per image and that the labels are just as trustworthy as if professional scientists classified galaxies. "
